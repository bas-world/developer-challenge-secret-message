# Assessment Developer (up to a Senior-level) - Secret message

At BAS Tech we primarily use PHP for our service development. We create web applications, 
APIs, microservices, (native) apps and a monolithic intranet. 

We're very interested to see how you develop. Having something in a working fashion is
secondary to be being able to explain why you did what you did. 

This is because we believe that anyone can learn a language, framework and ecosystem 
surrounding a language/framework. The hard parts are explaining choices you made, following
design patterns and writing human-readable code. 

## Requirements

- Use Git versioning system
- Your application must run with a maximum of 3 commands:
  - clone
  - install dependencies
  - (optional) start Docker containers

If you forego the Docker part, we will be running it in a Docker instance running: 

- PHP ^8.1
- MySQL ^8.0
- Node ^17

Make sure to upload your project to a VCS system (preferably Github) and provide us with
the (public) link to be able to clone it. 

_**Spend an approximate maximum of 4 hours on the assignment**_

_Remember: your choices of how to work matter more than the final product_

### Optional things

- Use a framework of choice
- If instructions are needed for us to run your project, make sure to include them in the ReadMe
- Have the project be (partially) tested
